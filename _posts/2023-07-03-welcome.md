Hi there! I'm glad you found your way to my portfolio website. My name is Connor Neville, and while this website is brand new as of this writing, I've been working in software development since 2016 - mostly as an iOS Engineer, though more recently as an Engineering Manager at [Hopper](https://hopper.com). I love learning, building products that solve a need for its users, and collaborating with talented people. For more information about my past work, see my [About]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/about.md %}) page.

I've created this website with a couple different goals in mind:
* To express who I am as a professional, in case it may lead to meaningful connections in the future.
* To share what I know. One of my favorite parts of software development are the communities, from which I've learned a lot. I'm not a great writer, and I know it, but if I can contribute a technical idea that’s helpful to someone, I'd like to.

So, whether you’re here because of a possible collaboration opportunity or for the technical content, I hope this reference proves useful. Feel free to use the [Contact]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/contact.md %}) form to get in touch.
