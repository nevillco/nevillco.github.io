Hey, I’m Connor. I’ve contributed to a lot of different software projects in a few different ways, but above all I'm a *Software Engineer specializing in iOS, with experience managing teams*. I graduated from Boston College in 2016 and have worked in a variety of roles and contexts since then, but always with the goal of building useful and enjoyable software. 

I have experience building at scale and building from scratch, and I enjoy contributing to product teams both on an individual scale and by scoping out and coordinating larger units of work. Working alongside friendly, thoughtful, talented folks will always be at the top of my list of priorities. 

I spent 5 years in a Boston-based agency (Raizlabs, then Rightpoint post-acquisition), which enabled me to work on a wide range of mobile apps, including ones in fitness, social, travel, and eCommerce. Highlights from this chapter include launching the mobile app for the [Dubai Fitness Challenge](https://www.dubaifitnesschallenge.com) on time for their yearly city-wide fitness challenge, and supporting a world-class accessibility app in [BlindWays](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blindways-bus-stop-navigation/id1146615175). I had a brief stint as a Senior iOS Engineer at [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com), where I planned and built multiple features enhancing the in-app customer support experience. And most recently, I've served as both a Senior iOS Engineer and an Engineering Manager at [Hopper](https://hopper.com) on the Price Freeze team, where I led the development of Hotel Price Freeze from its first smoke test in the iOS app to a reliable vertical grossing $800k+ every month. I later oversaw a redesign of our Air Price Freeze purchase funnel, using our in-house server-driven UI, and hired up a team of engineers to build and support it.
