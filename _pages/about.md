My name is Connor Neville. I graduated from Boston College in 2016 with a B.S. in Computer Science, and by the time I did, I had discovered a passion for building iOS apps. I also experimented with some Java Swing and command line tools in those early years, but I definitely knew I wanted to build software that people would enjoy using.
