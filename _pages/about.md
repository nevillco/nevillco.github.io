Hi, my name is Connor Neville. While I like to contribute to software teams however I can, most simply put, I am a Software Engineer with Engineering Management experience who specializes in iOS and the mobile space. Since graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science from Boston College in 2016, I've collected 7 years of hands-on experience working on iOS apps while leading a cross-functional team for the last 2 years. I have experience building at scale and building from scratch, and I enjoy contributing to product teams both on an individual scale and by scoping out and coordinating larger units of work. Working alongside friendly, thoughtful, talented folks will always be at the top of my priority list. I would call the following topics my strongest areas of expertise:
* Platforms: iOS
* Languages: Swift
* Frameworks: UIKit, SwiftUI, Composable Architecture, Tuist, RxSwift, Vapor, Firebase
* Concepts: Testability, snapshot testing, reactive programming, build tooling

And I have some lesser experience in:
* Languages: Scala, JavaScript
* Frameworks: TypeScript, Jekyll
